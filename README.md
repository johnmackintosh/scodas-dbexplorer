# scodas-dbexplorer
code for SQL queries to loop over database tables,  and shiny app to display / monitor values,  presented at SCODAS meeting 2022-06-14

N.B. - there are 2 versions of the app.  
The version demonstrated, which has one dashboard tab, is in the main branch.  

Use the app-with-metadata branch for revised layout, featuring an additional tab and table which displays metadata about the current selected table.  

See the screenshot below to navigate to the app-with-metadata branch:
